# CultureConnect : Global Cultural Awareness Database

## **Project Purpose and Goals:**
CultureConnect is a platform designed to make trusted, locally sourced cultural information accessible to everyone. Despite the reach of social media and globalization, many people still have limited exposure to other cultures—often leading to awkward interactions or unintentional insensitivity. CultureConnect seeks to close that gap by organizing reliable, locally verified cultural data by country, making it easier for anyone to learn, understand, and engage respectfully across cultures.

## **Goals:**

1. Build a relational database with sample cultural data for 3–5 countries
2. Include categories like holidays, greetings, values, dos/don’ts, and key historical facts
3. Use MySQL for core data, MongoDB for flexible descriptions, HTML/CSS for a lightweight frontend
